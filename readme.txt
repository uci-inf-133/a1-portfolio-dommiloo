--Readme document for *YOUR NAME*, *YOUR_EMAIL@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.

1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

*/10
- */1 Readme
- */2 Basic HTML content
- */1 Basic CSS styling
- */1 Advanced feature
- */2 Responsive layout
- */1 Passes validation checks
- */2 Embraces spirit of the assignment

2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features

    My project included basic features in html like links, buttons, navigation, images, bulleted lists


(b) CSS features

Tons of css features, smooth scrolling, navigator snaps to position on screen, various colors, circular headshot border
hover mechanics on cards, clean google outfit fonts, clean and smooth animation transitions, a header that follows when users scroll, a responsive design
accounting for other user  platforms.



(c) Advanced features
i think the most advanced feature is my working contact form. Using a websit "formspree.io" I  could create a live contact form that sends whatever message in the box 
to my actual email via formspree. This could be really convenient for future employers.  




3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.

I didn't ignore any of them, most of them were simple syntax errors, none of them seemed ignoreable/

4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?

I would say roughly 6-7 hours, hard to say exactly as i sat for multiple sessions,but  definitely more than 5 hours



5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)

Youtube: looked up how to use form spree: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVPlb5C3oQ8, watched a general css tips youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhaz36TZG5Y
reddit threads for general html questions, like inserting an image in my html - https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1gw410/html_and_inserting_an_image_from_my_computer/
looked up on google how to use google fonts in code, ai response gave answer
countless

used html geeksforgeeks quite often to refer to the countless syntax i would always forget: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/html-tutorial/



6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
Talked with a classmate Emily Tran regarding there plan for their portfolio, we bounced ideas off eachother. I introduced her 
to formspree


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
I dont believe so
